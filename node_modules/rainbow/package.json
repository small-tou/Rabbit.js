  "readme": "Rainbow\n=======\n\nA node [Express][] router middleware for Ajax RESTful API base on certain folder path.\n\nRainbow mapping all HTTP request route to controllers folder each as path to file as URL.\n\n## Installation ##\n\n```bash\n$ npm install rainbow\n```\n\n## Usage ##\n\nIn your express application main file `app.js`:\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar rainbow = require('rainbow');\n\nvar app = express();\n\n// Here using Rainbow to initialize all routers\nrainbow.route(app);\n\napp.listen(6060);\n```\n\n### Controllers ###\n\nAll your controllers for catching HTTP request should be defined in each file in `controllers/` folder (could be changed) as same path in URL.\n\nThis is the core design for Rainbow! And it makes routing much simpler only by files' paths!\n\nHere writes a router `something.js` in your `controllers/` folder like this:\n\n```javascript\nexports.get = {\n\t// filters were introduced below\n\tfilters: ['authorization'],\n\t// your real business process handler\n\tprocess: function (req, res, next) {\n\t\tres.send(200, 'Got you!');\n\t}\n};\n```\n\nIf you don't need any filters, just write simplier like this:\n\n```javascript\nexports.get = function (req, res, next) {\n\tres.send(200, 'Simple getting.');\n};\n```\n\nAlso you could define other HTTP methods handlers, but make sure in one file each URL! Example in `controllers/user.js`:\n\n```javascript\nexports.get = function (req, res, next) {\n\tUser.find({where: req.query.name}).success(function (user) {\n\t\tres.send(200, user);\n\t});\n};\n\nexports.put = function (req, res, next) {\n\tUser.create(req.body).success(function (user) {\n\t\tres.send(201, user.id);\n\t});\n};\n\n// You can also define `post` and `delete` handlers.\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you want all methods to be process in only one controller(something not RESTful), just make exports to be the handle function:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = function (req, res, next) {\n\t// all your process\n};\n```\n\n#### Notice ####\n\nRainbow controllers only design for tranditional URL form like `/path?query=value` but not like `/path/user/:id` yet.\n\nIn rich Ajax apps tranditional URL form could be more useful. However, Rainbow may consider param form URL in future versions.\n\n### Filters ###\n\nMake sure the filters you need had been defined in `filters/` folder (could be changed) as same module name, because them will be required when initilizing. Here `authorization.js` is a example for intecepting by non-authenticated user before `GET` `http://yourapp:6060/something`:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = function (req, res, next) {\n\tconsole.log('processing authorization...');\n\tvar session = req.session;\n\t\n\tif (session.userId) {\n\t\tconsole.log('user(%d) in session', session.userId);\n\t\tnext();\n\t} else {\n\t\tconsole.log('out of session');\n\t\t// Async filter is ok with express!\n\t\tdb.User.find().success(function (user) {\n\t\t\tif (!user) {\n\t\t\t\tres.send(403);\n\t\t\t\tres.end();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\t}\n};\n```\n\nYou could see filters is as same as a origin router in Express, just be put together in `filters/` folder to be interceptors like in Java SSH.\n\n### Change default path ###\n\nControllers and filters default path could be changed by passing a path config object to `route` function when initializing:\n\n```javascript\nrainbow.route(app, {\n\tcontrollers: 'your/controllers/path',\n\tfilters: 'your/filters/path'\n});\n```\n\nThese paths are all **RELATIVE** to your app path!\n\n## Troubleshooting ##\n\n0.
