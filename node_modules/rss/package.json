  "readme": "# RSS for Node\n\n  Fast and simple Javascript-based RSS generator/builder for Node projects.\n\n## Install\n\n    $ npm install rss\n\n## Tests\n\n Use [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) to run the tests.\n\n    $ npm install nodeunit\n    $ nodeunit test\n\n## Usage\n\n    var RSS = require('rss');\n\n    /* lets create an rss feed */\n    var feed = new RSS({\n            title: 'title',\n            description: 'description',\n            feed_url: 'http://example.com/rss.xml',\n            site_url: 'http://example.com',\n            image_url: 'http://example.com/icon.png',\n            author: 'Dylan Greene'\n        });\n\n    /* loop over data and add to feed */\n    feed.item({\n        title:  'item title',\n        description: 'use this for the content. It can include html.',\n        url: 'http://example.com/article4?this&that', // link to the item\n        guid: '1123', // optional - defaults to url\n        author: 'Guest Author', // optional - defaults to feed author property\n        date: 'May 27, 2012' // any format that js Date can parse.\n    });\n\n    // cache the xml\n    var xml = feed.xml();\n\n### Feed Options\n\n * _title_ <string> Title of your site or feed\n * _description_ <string> Optional. Short description of the feed.\n * _feed_url_ <url> Url to the rss feed.\n * _site_url_ <url> Url to the site that the feed is for.\n * _image_url_ <url> Optional. Small image for feed readers to use.\n * _author_ <string> Who owns this feed.\n\n### Item Options\n\nIn RSS an item can be used for a blog entry, project update, log entry, etc.  Your rss feed\nan have any number of items. Ten to tenty is usually good.\n\n * _title_ <string> Title of this particular item.\n * _description_ <string> Content for the item.  Can contain html but link and image urls must include the server name.\n (Note: I might change this to content in the next release.)\n * _url_ <url> Url to the item. This could be a blog entry.\n * _guid_ <unique string> A unique string feed readers use to know if an item is new or has already been seen.\n If you use a guid never change it.  If you don't provide a guid then your item urls must\n be unique.\n * _author_ <string> Optional.  If included it is the name of the item's creator.\n If not provided the item author will be the same as the feed author.  This is typical\n except on multi-author blogs.\n * _date_ <Date object or date string> The date and time of when the intem was created.  Feed\n readers use this to determin the sort order. Some readers will also use it to determin\n if the content should be presented as unread.\n\n### Methods\n\n * _item(item_options)_ - add an rss item, article, entry etc.\n * _xml([indent])_ - return the xml.  If you pass in true it will use four spaces for indenting. If you prefer\n tabs use \\t instead of true.\n\n## Notes\n * You do not need to escape anything. This module will escape characters when necessary.\n * This module is very fast but you might as well cache the output of xml() and serve\n it until something changes.\n\n## Upcoming features\n\n * Atom support\n * Feed validation\n * Feedburner integration\n * More customization\n * Express middleware for serving feeds\n * What else?\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions to the project are welcome.
